For users with no created content this data will be deleted after a few days of inactivity.

## Data Removal
• Users can request their data to be removed by contacting our Staff Team at: https://kietsu.xyz/support.

## User Data
We collect little to no Discord User Data just what servers you are in, avatar, username & id but once you sign out it is deleted as it is stored publicly via cookies!

1. Allowing Kietsu to collect and store your:
